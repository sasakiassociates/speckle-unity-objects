# speckle-unity-objects

An unofficial set of speckle converters and objects built for unity. This project was started from the main [speckle-unity](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-unity) project, but has been moved into different repos for more modular package support with unity.  

 This package features: 
- `ConverterUnity` - The main scriptable speckle converter
- A basic list of component converters that handle main speckle objects in unity
- A basic set of unity components for creating speckle objects in unity.   
 
If you are looking for a more complete unity pacakge take a look at [speckle-unity-connector](https://github.com/sasakiassociates/speckle-unity-connector)
 
This pacakge can be installed with [OpenUpm](https://github.com/openupm/openupm-cli#installation) 

`openupm add com.speckle.objects`


## Roadmap

All roadmap information is available in the main package repo, [speckle-unity-connector](https://github.com/sasakiassociates/speckle-unity-connector)  


### Additional 
There are additional packages in active development.

- Main client and operations package  
[speckle-unity-core](https://github.com/sasakiassociates/speckle-unity-core)

- Core and Objects wrapped together with some additional GUI, probably the more ideal package to install 
[speckle-unity-connector](https://github.com/sasakiassociates/speckle-unity-connector)
